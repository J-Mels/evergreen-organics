FEATURES

- Harmful pesticide free
  -----Don't be fooled by "organic" labels at the supermarket. Many commercially available organic products use the same harmful pesticides as non-organics.
  At Evergreen, we derive our pesticides from purely natural sources, not lab-created chemicals. Furthermore, all produce is meticulously washed and inspected before being shipped. That's our promise to you.

- Nutrient rich - dark colored greens/veggies
  -----Studies by nutritionists have shown that the richness of a fruit or vegetable's color is directly linked to the amount of nutrients they contain. GMO-laden produce from supermarkets are often severely lacking in the darker, richer colors, denoting an equally severe lack of nutritional value. We pledge to never use GMO in any of our produce and utilize the finest of fertilizers to produce colorful, nutrient-rich produce that tastes better and makes you feel better.

- Packaging uses fully recycled/environmentally sustainable materials
- 100% Vegan and cruelty free
  ----- It is our mission to not only deliver excellence to our customers, but also to our planet. All of our produce is 100% Vegan and cruelty-free. Furthermore, we utilize 100% recycled materials in all of our packaging.

- Freshly delivered
  ----- When you order from us, the produce will be freshly picked from the farm then delivered to your home or business within 48 hours. No exceptions. Evergreen also makes your shopping experience easy with an option for recurring purchases, saving you time. Going on vacation? No problem! You can pause your recurring deliveries with ease and resume them when you are ready.

- Variety - imported vegetables
  ----- We grow a wide array of everyday products as well as exotic fruits, veggies, nuts, spices, and more. Cook native cuisine from any region in the world and make all your culinary dreams come true with Evergreen!

- State-of-the-art facilities (hydroponics, greenhouses)
  ----- In order to guarantee maximum taste, nutrition and freshness, we grow our produce in state-of-the-art facilities using cutting-edge advancements in agriculture. We utilize traditional farms, greenhouses, and hydroponic farms to ensure each variety of produce is nutrient rich and grown in an environmentally sustainable way.
